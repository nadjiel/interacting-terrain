# Interacting Terrain
This prototype, created in Godot 4.3, showcases an interactive terrain concept utilizing tile maps with custom tile data.

The aim is to test a solution that enables the game to respond dynamically to collisions with various tile types.

The final product allows developers to implement effects such as leaves flying from grass when a player walks by or water ripples when a player moves through water tiles.

The implemented solution is based on the approach demonstrated by [@DevDuck](https://www.youtube.com/@DevDuck) in his video: [How to Use Custom Tile Data in Godot 4 | Dauphin Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9RsnbP4a0c).

Most of the sprite assets for this project were sourced from [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).

These assets originate from the Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX.

This project was created solely for educational purposes, and utilizes these resources because creating new ones was beyond its scope, and they were readily available.
